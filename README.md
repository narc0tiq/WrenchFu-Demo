This is an add-on to the [Factorio](http://www.factorio.com/) mod
[WrenchFu](https://github.com/narc0tiq/WrenchFu). It gives WrenchFu's the
ability to trigger a renaming GUI for assembling machines (which uses the
`backer_name`, normally unset for assembly machines).


## Usage ##

Get yourself a WrenchFu wrench and take it in your hand, then click an assembly
machine. This should trigger a GUI to open, where you can type in the machine's
new name. Click Save if you're happy with it, or just walk away and let the GUI
close itself if you've changed your mind.
